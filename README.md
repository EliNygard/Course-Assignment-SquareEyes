[Visit Square Eyes](https://elinygard.github.io/Course-Assignment-SquareEyes/index.html)

## Description
This is a web page for the fictional client Square Eyes. A site where you can buy and watch films online. 

The goal was to put into practice everything I’ve learned about HTML and CSS over this second course at Front-end Developent Studies at Noroff, by bringing my design from the Design CA alive.


#### Info about the client and instructions:
The museum is opening soon. Its core target audience is primary and middle school children (ages 7-15) and families with young children.

The site should appeal to youngsters without pandering; while aiming at a younger audience it should not patronise them with overtly childish themes. The core purpose of the site is to excite and entice people to visit the museum.

## Built With
I have used Figma to design the web page, and built it with HTML and CSS.
