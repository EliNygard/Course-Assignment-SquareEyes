MUST FIX: 
download font family Inter failed
decide on max-width: 1440px or wider 
mobile: smaller images in horror page - not so wide



Desktop:
Dropdown - line number 2 with categories. Links on all categories. Klarer ikke å få den ned på ny linje. REPORT
Horror bigger font
Horror: hover on film - darker transition
Filmpage: smaller film image. Center content. Align icons. New icons? 
Checkout: Move button Back to left side
Playwindow: center image
Banner: adjust font size

Mobile:
button on blue background under header
smaller icons in header
contact us: bigger button


All:
Header much taller. Create new gradient on website?
Space before footer


NOT WORKING PERFECTLY:
Button in banner when scaling down. Moves. Landed on % instead of rem. REPORT
Grid on horror page. 2 columns with too much gap


IF TIME:
Image slider/carousel on filmpage. If not: in report: couldt make one I got to function in css
contact: name change: section --> div. because there is no h1 in the header


 

/*buttons.css*/
gather styles in cta, make adjustment to the others
- adjust classes cta cta-mobile osv
- do i even use cta-mobile -desktop?


/*home*/
Place button
Dropdown: set max width, size osv
Remove scroll line?


/*header*/
[Navigation: I created two, couldn't figure out if it was possible with one and design them for mobile/desktop - hence they are a bit different.] 
Gratient smoother
Dropdown on desktop: new line on dropdown
name change: section --> div. because there is no h1 in the header



/*filmlist*/
How can the gap stay the same when moving between screen sizes?
                            

/*film page*/
(Find new icons)
større font på details
cast/crew use h2
name change: section --> div. because there is no h1 in the header
 
/*footer**/
greate grid and flex elements
do I need nav element before div?


/*buttons*/
low contrast pink/white. darker pink?
